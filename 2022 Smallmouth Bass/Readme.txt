Hello! This is the folder containing data for the project, 
 "A comparative analysis of the behavioural and fitness consequences of using chemical anaesthesia, electroanaesthesia, and electrostunning on a wild fish"

The files have been divided and posted as .CSVs, since this is what I used for the data analysis, and include a few typo corrections in the original datasheets. 
With that said, earlier versions of the datasheets (digital and physical) are available. For this or other questions, please reach out to me at connorreid@cmail.carleton.ca.
